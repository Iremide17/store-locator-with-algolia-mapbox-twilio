In this session
* We first added the data in a side list using <InstantSearch> and <Hits> wrappers
* We’ve refined this list with the <Configure/> component and we passed ‘aroundLatLngViaIP’ in order to get results around us. 
* We’ve created a Map using Mapbox 
* We’ve connected it to our React InstantSearch instance using connectGeoSearch() HOC.
* Finally we’ve added a Search as I move the map checkbox to improve our UX.
